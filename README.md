# Sphere-Last-Passage
We use Sphere Last Passage Algorithm to compute the charge density at a specific point (along the diagonal) on the conducting surface, which is a cube in our case.
The program file itself includes annotated comments for better understanding. 
For finalized version, following subroutines were changed: walk on planes, back to sphere, infinity check.
Compilation is done via g++ for F90.
